# Front end’s library:
React 16.4.2

Redux 4 (used for  managing application state on react)

Redux Thunk (used as a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object.)

emotion js (used as a performant and flexible CSS-in-JS library.Emotion is a performant and flexible CSS-in-JS library. Building on many other CSS-in-JS libraries, it allows you to style apps quickly with string or object styles. It has predictable composition to avoid specificity issues with CSS. With source maps and labels, Emotion has a great developer experience and great performance with heavy caching in production.)

React Router 4 (used as  a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever React is rendering--so take your pick!)

Axios js (used for making HTTP requests to fetch or save data is one of the most common tasks a client-side JavaScript application will need to do)

draft js (used as a framework for building rich text editors in React, powered by an immutable model and abstracting over cross-browser differences.)

React-draft-wysiwyg (a Wysiwyg editor built using ReactJS and DraftJS libraries)

React Toastify (used for allowing you to add notification to your app.)

React Moment (used for Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript.)

React Scroll (used as a component for animating vertical scrolling.)
